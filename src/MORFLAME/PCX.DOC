Pcx utils is good enough for sprite grabbing from a 320x200x256 pcx file.
Thiz generates a binary file if you choose with the mouse (followed by 'b').
It generates also a palette include file. There are other hidden options...
I used this old stuff (I programmed this one year ago, with f* pascal)
to generate my textures (morfloor.bin, morceil.bin).
