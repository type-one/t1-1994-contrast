In the early 90s I was pre-computing in GFA Basic my tables / some asm opcodes used in the ASM source.
My friends were using Turbo Pascal 7.0 to generate similar pre-computed tables or x86 code. 

GFA Basic was a popular language on the Atari ST that was then ported to MS-DOS PC (GFA Basic 4.31).
It was a structured basic that could be interpreted or compiled, similar to MS Visual Basic, except
that GFA was already available on Atari in the end of the 80s.

archives on GFA are available at

The GFA files in this folder were used to generate precomputed information.  Not sure if they
correspond to the last release, but this is what I could find back on my 28 years old backup.

Turbo Pascal was popular on PC/MS-DOS at that time and was teached as academic language to learn 
algorithms and programming.
