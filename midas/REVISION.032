        MIDAS Sound System v0.32 Revision History
	-----------------------------------------

07-Aug-1994 (JP & PK)
---------------------
        MIDAS Sound System v0.32 released at ASSEMBLY '94 in
        Helsinki, Finland.

RAWFILE.*
        New low-level file handling routines for better platform
        independency.

ASMRFILE.ASM
        New low-level file routines written totally in
        assembler. Can be used with 16-bit Pascal and C.

FILE.*
        New high-level file routines. All module loaders use
        these instead of C library functions. This makes using
        other methods for storing the data, such as compressed
        file libraries, much easier.

S3M.PAS
MODP.PAS
MODLOAD.C
S3MLOAD.C
        Scream Tracker 3 and Protracker module loaders no
        longer use C library functions. Pascal loaders have been
        removed, and now the Pascal version uses loaders written
        in C.

DSM.ASM
GUS.ASM
        SoundDevice.Pause() and SoundDevice.Mute() functions
        have been implemented for all Sound Devices.

DSM.ASM
        Amiga Loop Emulation has been implemented for the DSM
        too. This allows much more accurate playing of Pro
        Tracker modules.

S3M.ASM
MOD.ASM
MPLAYER.*
        ModulePlayer.SetMasterVolume has been implemented. It
        was included in the structure earlier, but "disappeared"
        at some stage.

MIDP.C
        MIDP is now at version 0.42.
        A timer has been added on the screen.
        'T' now toggles the active channel on/off.
        'P' pauses playing, and Space mutes.
        DMP-compatible default panning has been added,
        command-line option '-n'.
        Also some other minor changes and bug fixes.


*.*
        Lots of other changes, like bug fixes.



        Changes to revision B
	---------------------


14-Aug-1994 (PK)
----------------
VU.ASM
	Fixed a bug in VU meters with some long looping samples.



15-Aug-1994 (JP)
----------------
GUS.ASM
	Fixed a bug in gusClearChans.  It didn't work unless gusPlay was
	still called.
	Also fixed strange clicking when muting surround channels.
	Some other internal changes and optimizations.



15-Aug-1994 (PK)
----------------
MIDAS.PAS
        Fixed a tiny but fatal bug. asczBuffer was being
        initialized to NULL but was never allocated - ASCIIZ
        conversions went to address 0000:0000.



16-Aug-1994 (PK)
----------------
*.*
        MIDAS Sound System v0.32b released.


02-Nov-1994 (PK)
----------------
SB.ASM
        A small bug in SB 16 support fixed. In Sound Blaster 16
        16-bit output modes, the interrupt is acknowledged by reading
        port 2xFh, not 2xEh as in all other output modes. Thanks,
        Otto!

        MIDAS Sound System v0.32b released. A small bug fix in SB 16
        16-bit output support. This version was not supposed to be
        released at all, but as v0.40 is still delayed, we wanted to
        release this small SB 16 fix. Note that this version is not,
        unlike v0.40, tested under a SB 16, but the Sound Blaster
        support code is practically identical.
