MIDAS Module Player is a program for playing Protracker and Scream
Tracker 3 modules. It uses MIDAS Sound System, also by us, which is
now available for the public for free of charge. All source code is
included. Read MIDAS.TXT for more information about MIDAS Sound System.



        Foreword
        --------

As the version number suggests, this is not a final version of MIDP.
The most important reason for releasing MIDP as a separate executable
is to get MIDAS Sound System properly tested. In the future MIDP will
include loads of nice features, like proper archiver support,
customizable outlook etc, but for now you must live with what you have
got. The MIDAS Sound System archive includes full source code for MIDP
too, so if you know C you can tailor MIDP to suit for your needs.

What we now want from you is feedback. Run MIDP on your own computer,
experiment with it, bang it with strange modules and try to crash it.
After you know what works and what doesn't, please tell us. The
preferred method is of course via e-mail, because it is fast and
convenient for us and probably free for you. We are most interested in
hearing whether the Sound Devices work on your sound card. So if you
don't have time to experiment with MIDP for a long time, we would
appreciate if you could at least run it once or twice with different
output modes, and tell us whether it worked or not.

When giving us feedback, especially bug reports, please remember to
include information about your computer system, especially the type of
your sound card. Please also include, if possible, the MIDAS error list
given by MIDP on an error situation. It gives us invaluable information
about the error and, even more importantly, where that error occurred.
This way we have better chances of finding the bugs.

Unlike most other module players, MIDP is not commercial, shareware, or
even cardware. But, if you like MIDP, nothing naturally stops you from
sending us something, money, a postcard or whatever. We would hope to
get at least a "Hey, MIDP works with my xxx sound card" e-mail message.



        Sound Devices
        -------------

MIDAS uses all sound cards through modules called Sound Devices.
Currently there are Sound Devices for the following sound cards:

        1. Gravis UltraSound
                * Should work with all GUS versions. Some problems have
                  been reported on GUS v3.x, but as we only have a v2
                  GUS we have not been able to test them ourselves.
                  Most v3 specific bugs should be fixed for this
                  version, however.

        2. Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum family
                * This includes PAS, PAS+ and PAS 16
                * Note that the PAS Sound Device always attempts to use
                  16-bit output unless otherwise told, so with PAS or
                  PAS+ sound cards, you must use the command-line option
                  -o8. In addition to this, with normal PAS you should
                  also set the mixing rate to 22kHz or less, using
                  -m22000. This will be fixed in the near future.

        3. Microsoft Windows Sound System
                * Should also work with other WSS compatible cards,
                  such as Compaq Business Audio, and is tested to work
                  with Audiotrix Pro.
                * Note that there is no autodetection for WSS, so you
                  must force the correct settings using the command
                  line options (ie. -s3 -p530 -i9 -d3)

        4. Creative Labs Sound Blaster series
                * Fully supports SB 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, SB Pro and SB 16.
                * Attempts to always use DMA channel 1, so with SB 16
                  you have to force the correct "High-DMA" channel (ie.
                  -d5)

        5. No Sound
                * Plays nothing, is always used when nothing else is
                  detected.
                * Just to allow sound synchronization even with no
                  sound card.

Note that both the GUS and SB Sound Device use direct hardware
detection routines, and might therefore cause problems on some
computers. In that case, simply force the settings from the command
line. This will be fixed in the future, as all detection will be done
using the environment variables.



        MIDP Usage:
        -----------

The command line syntax for MIDP is:

        MIDP [options] <filenames> [options]

        At least one module file name must be included. MIDP also
        supports multiple modules and wildcards.

Options:
        -sx     Force Sound Device x (1 = GUS, 2 = PAS, 3 = WSS, 4 = SB,
                5 = No Sound)
        -pxxx   Force I/O port xxx (hex) for Sound Device
        -ix     Force IRQ x for Sound Device
        -dx     Force DMA channel x for Sound Device
        -mxxxx  Set mixing rate to xxxx Hz
        -oxxx   Force output mode (8 = 8-bit, 1 = 16-bit, s = stereo,
                m = mono)
        -e      Disable EMS usage
        -t      Disable ProTracker BPM tempos
        -u      Enable Surround sound (affects only GUS)
        -v      Disable real VU-meters
        -------
        -S      Jump immediately to DOS shell
        -c      Disable timer screen synchronization
        -C      Enable timer screen synchronization also in DOS shell
        -Lx     Number of song loops before next song
        -O      Scramble module playing order

Also '/' is recognized as option delimiter.
Note that the options are CASE SENSITIVE.



        MIDAS environment variable
        --------------------------

MIDAS Sound System specific options (above the line in the command
line option list above) can also be set to environment variable MIDAS,
so that they do not have to be entered every time. The syntax is
exactly the same as with the command line options. Also other programs
that use MIDAS Sound System will probably recognize the environment
variable.

Example:
        SET MIDAS=-s3 -p530 -i9 -d3 -om -m32000



        MIDP keys
        ---------

When playing a module, MIDP can be controlled using the following keys:
(most of these are same as in DMP, so learning them should not be very
difficult...)

        Alt-X           Quick exit
        Left/Right      Next / Previous position
        Up/Down         Select active channel
        Esc             Exit with fade out
        +/-             Increase / Decrease master volume
        D               Jump to DOS shell
        1-9, 0          Toggle channels on/off
        ,/.             Adjust active channel panning left / right
        M               Set active channel panning to middle
        L               Set active channel panning to left
        R               Set active channel panning to right
        U               Set active channel panning to surround
        T               Toggle active channel on/off
        P               Pause module. Press P to continue
        Space           Mute playing. Press Space again to un-mute
        N               Next module

Plus some internal debugging keys (someone would try these anyway):
        F               Lists all free blocks in heap
        H               Lists all memory blocks in heap



        Archive support
        ---------------

MIDP also includes a primitive archive support, built as we ourselves
needed it. When playing a file with extension .ZIP, .MDZ or .S3Z, MIDP
first decompresses the file using PKUNZIP to the directory set by
environment variable "TEMP", or to C:\ if none is set. Then the first
file from that directory with same name as the archive (but with any
extension) will be played and deleted immediately after playing starts.
When multiple archives are being played, the decompression of the next
start immediately after starting to play the previous one, to give
almost uninterrupted background music.

Archive support will be enhanced in the future, after we implement some
kind of configuration file, to include any archivers and extensions.
But for now on this must do.



        The future
        ----------

Future versions of MIDP will include:

        1. Configuration file, with ability to change archivers,
           extensions, colors, palette and probably redefine some
           characters from the display.

        2. Less bugs (depending on your bug reports).

        3. No debug code (if 2 ever comes true)
