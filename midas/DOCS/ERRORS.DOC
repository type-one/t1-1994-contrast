        MIDAS Sound System error handling
        ---------------------------------

All MIDAS Sound System functions use an unified method for error
handling. They all return an error code, which will be OK if no error
occurred. If "DEBUG" has been defined in compilation, errors will also
be added to MIDAS error list, with an ID number of the function that
caused the error. This greatly helps debugging, as both the function
that originally caused the error as well as the functions calling it
can easily be seen. For a full list of function ID numbers, see
FUNCTIDS.TXT.
