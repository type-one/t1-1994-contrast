        Licensing MIDAS Sound System for commercial purposes
        ----------------------------------------------------

Even though you are not allowed to use this version of MIDAS Sound
System for commercial programs, commercial licenses are also available.
Contact us for more information. There is no set price for MIDAS, but
for most purposes the price would be 500USD per-product, assuming that
we don't have to do very much extra work for you. Other licensing
methods, like unlimited license for a one-time fee, are also available.

We know that, in general, the license is much too strict for any
practical purposes. It is, however, the only way we can be sure that
MIDAS will not be used for commercial programs.  We have already had
problems with Jarno's Amiga player being illegally used for commercial
programs by companies like _TEAM 17_. They did not even bother telling
him what they are doing, much less correctly licensing his Player. The
license in his Player was probably not restrictive enough.

Even with this license, we are still taking a risk when making MIDAS
Sound System available to the public. This public release is mostly
aimed at demo programmers, with the hope that we do not have to see any
more GUS-only demos with even no support for no-sound. We hope that
MIDAS will be useful to all software developers, especially as its
source code is available.

If, however, the license is violated, we will have to stop releasing
any more public versions of MIDAS. We can still make it available for
non-commercial usage, but as any other method of distribution would
mean expenses for us, we could no longer offer MIDAS Sound System for
free. We do not want to charge money for non-commercial usage, and so
we hope that we do not have to go into this.

The moral of the story is this: By illegally using MIDAS Sound System
in a commercial product, you not only cause legal problems for
yourself, but make it impossible for hundreds or even thousands of
other programmers to get free versions of MIDAS for their personal
usage. This way you are guaranteed to get massive amounts of new
enemies, which surely will not make your product more successful...
