        MIDAS Sound System future versions
        ----------------------------------

Coming soon (?) to MIDAS:

        - More documentation
        - More examples
        - 8-bit low-quality mixing routines for faster speed
        - Sound amplification in normal-quality 8-bit mixing routines
          for better sound quality.


Coming at least to MIDAS v1.00:
        - Full documentation


Future versions of MIDAS will be released when we have time to finish
them. Bug fixes and small updates to current MIDAS version will be
released before that, however, in archives containing just the changed
files for that revision. The file names will be MDSSxxxy.ZIP, where xxx
is MIDAS version number and y revision (a-z).
