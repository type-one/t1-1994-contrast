        MIDAS Sound System known bugs and missing features
        --------------------------------------------------

- Pro Audio Spectrum series Sound Device (PAS.ASM) does not check for
  PAS version when setting output mode, but attempts to use 16-bit
  output on all cards unless otherwise told. This will be fixed in the
  future.

- Windows Sound System Sound Device does not contain a detection
  routine, and so when using MIDAS.* interface, a port, IRQ or DMA
  value must always be forced even if the defaults were correct. Some
  kind of detection routine will be added in the future, probably using
  an environment variable.

- Gravis Ultra Sound and Sound Blaster series Sound Devices use
  hardware detection routines, which may cause problems on some
  configurations and not be able to detect all possible values. Sound
  Blaster detection routine (sbDetect()) always attempts to use DMA
  channel 1. There detection routines will be changed in the future to
  use only the "ULTRASND" and "BLASTER" environment settings.

- Not all Sound Device member functions are currently implemented. This
  includes at least SD.Mute() and SD.Pause(). All Sound Device
  functions will be fully implemented at least before version 1.00.

- Amiga Loop Emulation is not implemented in DSM, which is used by all
  Sound Devices except GUS. ALE will be added to DSM in the future.

- Protracker Module Player refuses to load modules with inaccurate
  period values or notes outsize octaves 1-3. This is not actually a
  bug, but rather a Protracker compatibility issue. Support for octaves
  0 and 4 will probably not be added to Protracker Module Player, as it
  would seriously affect compatibility with Protracker.
