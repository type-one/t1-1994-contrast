        MIDAS Sound System example programs
        -----------------------------------

MIDP.C                  MIDAS Module Player. Not very clear code, but
                        uses most of the features currently
                        implemented. To compile, use MIDP.MAK

DBP.C                   MIDAS debug module player. This might not be
                        fully up to date, as it is used only
                        for debugging purposes.  If you _REALLY_ want
                        to use MIDAS without the timer, and
                        think you know what you are doing, you
                        could look here for an example on how to
                        do that. To compile, use DBP.MAK

EXAMPLES\MPLAY.C        Minimal module player using MIDAS. This is
                        about as small as a full-featured module player
                        can get. Useful in getting you started. To
                        compile, use EXAMPLES\C_EXP.MAK

EXAMPLES\SCRDEMO.C      Example on using the Timer screen
                        synchronization to get smooth panning while
                        music is still playing. To compile, use
                        EXAMPLES\C_EXP.MAK


EXAMPLES\EFFECTS.C      Example on using simple sound effects with
                        MIDAS. A full-featured sound effect engine will
                        be included in the future, but for now on you
                        can use this as a basis for your own effect
                        system. To compile, use EXAMPLES\C_EXP.MAK

EXAMPLES\MPLAY.PAS      Minimal module player using MIDAS in Pascal.
                        To compile, use EXAMPLES\PAS_EXP.MAK

Note! C example programs in directory EXAMPLES need the MIDAS.LIB
library, and the Pascal examples the MIDAS.TPU unit. To build them use
MAKELIB.BAT and MAKETPU.BAT, respectively, in the main MIDAS directory.

DBP.PAS                 MIDAS Pascal debug module player. As this
                        mostly uses the MIDAS interface unit functions,
                        it can be used as an example. Also contains
                        code for manual polling. DBP is the only Pascal
                        program so far using the real VU-meters and
                        MP.GetInformation(), so it can be helpful with
                        them as well.
