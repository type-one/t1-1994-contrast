        MIDAS simple programming interface
        ----------------------------------

MIDAS.C & MIDAS.H and MIDAS.PAS contain a simplified MIDAS Sound System
programming interface, which allows easy integration of background
music into programs. They are not directly suitable for other kinds of
programs than stand-alone module players, but can serve as a basis for
building a tailored interface for your own needs.

The MIDAS programming interface also includes a command-line option and
environment string parser. While this kind of configuration is not
useful in most applications, they can serve as a quick setup system
during development phase, until you have time to build a better
configuration system for your own program. Again, the command-line
option parser can be used as a convenient basis for a setup program.

The MIDAS parser recognizes the following options:

        -sx     Force Sound Device x (1 = GUS, 2 = PAS, 3 = WSS, 4 = SB,
                5 = No Sound)
        -pxxx   Force I/O port xxx (hex) for Sound Device
        -ix     Force IRQ x for Sound Device
        -dx     Force DMA channel x for Sound Device
        -mxxxx  Set mixing rate to xxxx Hz
        -oxxx   Force output mode (8 = 8-bit, 1 = 16-bit, s = stereo,
                m = mono)
        -e      Disable EMS usage
        -t      Disable ProTracker BPM tempos
        -u      Enable Surround sound
        -v      Disable real VU-meters

Also '\' is recognized as an option delimiter.
