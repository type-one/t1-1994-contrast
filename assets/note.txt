Some assets I could find back on my old HDD drive backup.

IFF and LBM extension are for Deluxe Paint II IFF file format (256 colors), a popular painting software 
that existed on Amiga, MS-DOS PC and Atari ST.  In the 90s we were using the MS-DOS version.

PCX is for Paint Brush file format and it was a popular format used on PC for 256 colors images.

To convert the IFF and PCX pictures to raw data, we were using "alchemy" to convert pictures to raw.

Recoil library allows to load these legacy picture formats that were popular in the 80s and early
90s.
